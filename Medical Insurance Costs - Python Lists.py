# # Working with Python Lists: Medical Insurance Costs Project

# You are a doctor sorting through medical insurance cost data for some patients.
# 
# Using your knowledge of Python lists, you will store medical data and see what valuable insights you can gain from that data.
# 
# Let's get started!

# ## Exploring List Data

# 1. First, take a look at the two lists in the code block below.
# 
#    The list `names` stores the names of ten individuals, and `insurance_costs` stores their medical insurance costs.
#    
#    Let's add additional data to these lists:
#    - Append a new individual, `"Priscilla"`, to `names`.
#    - Append her insurance cost, `8320.0` to `insurance_costs`.

# In[2]:


names = ["Mohamed", "Sara", "Xia", "Paul", "Valentina", "Jide", "Aaron", "Emily", "Nikita", "Paul"]
insurance_costs = [13262.0, 4816.0, 6839.0, 5054.0, 14724.0, 5360.0, 7640.0, 6072.0, 2750.0, 12064.0]


# 2. Currently, the `names` and `insurance_costs` lists are separate, but we want each insurance cost to be paired with a name.
# 
#    Create a new variable called `medical_records` that combines `insurance_costs` and `names` into a list using the `zip()` function.
#    
#    The list should have the following structure:
#    
#    ```py
#    [(cost_0, name_0), (cost_1, name_1), (cost_2, name_2), ...]
#    ```

# In[6]:


medical_records = list(zip(insurance_costs, names))


# 3. Print out `medical_records` below, and make sure the output is what you expected.

# In[7]:


print(medical_records)


# 4. Let's explore our medical data.
# 
#    We want to see how many medical records we are dealing with. Create a variable called `num_medical_records` that stores the length of `medical_records`.

# In[8]:


num_medical_records = len(medical_records)


# 5. Print `num_medical_records` with the following message:
# 
#    ```
#    There are {number of medical records} medical records.
#    ```

# In[9]:


print("There are " + str(num_medical_records) + " medical records.")


# ## Selecting List Elements

# 6. Select the first medical record in `medical_records`, and save it to a variable called `first_medical_record`.

# In[10]:


first_medical_record = medical_records[0]


# 7. Print `first_medical_record` with the following message:
# 
#    ```
#    Here is the first medical record: {first medical record}
#    ```

# In[11]:


print("Here is the first medical record: " + str(first_medical_record))


# ## Sorting Lists

# 8. Sort `medical_records` so that the individuals with the lowest insurance costs appear at the start of the list.
# 
#    Print the sorted `medical_records` with the following message:
#    
#    ```
#    Here are the medical records sorted by insurance cost: {sorted list}
#    ```

# In[ ]:


medical_records.sort()
print("Here are the medical records sorted by insurance cost: " + str(medical_records))


# ## Slicing Lists

# 9. Let's look at the three cheapest insurance costs in our medical records.
# 
#    Slice the `medical_records` list, and store the three cheapest insurance costs in a list called `cheapest_three`.

# In[12]:


cheapest_three = medical_records[:3]


# 10. Print `cheapest_three` with the following message:
# 
#     ```py
#     Here are the three cheapest insurance costs in our medical records: {cheapest three}
#     ```

# In[13]:


print("Here are the three cheapest insurance costs in our medical records " + str(cheapest_three))


# 11. Let's look at the three most expensive insurance costs in our medical records.
# 
#     Slice the `medical_records` list, and store the three most expensive insurance costs in a list called `priciest_three`.

# In[14]:


priciest_three = medical_records[-3:]


# 12. Print `priciest_three` with the following message:
# 
#     ```
#     Here are the three most expensive insurance costs in our medical records: {priciest three}
#     ```

# In[15]:


print("Here are the three most expensive insurance costs in our medical records: " + str(priciest_three))


# ## Counting Elements in a List

# 13. Some individuals in our medical records have the same name. For example, the name "Paul" shows up twice.
# 
#     Count the number of occurrences of "Paul" in the `names` list, and store the result in a variable called `occurrences_paul`.
#     
#     Print `occurrences_paul` with the following message:
#     
#     ```
#     There are {occurrences Paul} individuals with the name Paul in our medical records.
#     ```

# In[17]:


occurrences_paul = names.count("Paul")
print("There are " + str(occurrences_paul) + " individuals with the name Paul in our medical records.")
